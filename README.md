# Editex
This is an example of a simple Text Editor which is developed in python using tkinter. This application is made only for the purpose of Learning. Now I am looking forward to improve the quality of the editor. Still some of the basic works are remaining like:
1. Adding a more elegant view for the app.
2. Creating icon for editor.
3. Adding various commands like cut, copy, paste and many more.
4. Making the application cross platform (Currently the application runs only on Windows). 
And many more :)
